# faceRecognitionAttendanceSystem

The Smart Attendance System is an intelligent, contactless solution designed to modernize traditional attendance-marking methods using advanced technologies such as facial recognition, liveness detection, QR authentication, and cloud integration. The system captures the user’s face in real time, extracts unique features, and verifies identity with high accuracy, ensuring fast and reliable attendance marking. To prevent misuse or proxy attempts, a built-in liveness detection module checks for natural facial movements, guaranteeing that only real individuals can authenticate. 
Along with facial recognition, a secure time-limited QR code option enables hybrid attendance marking for environments where camera access is limited or verification needs to be faster. User details, attendance logs, and authentication events are automatically stored in Firebase, enabling instant cloud synchronization and remote monitoring. A Telegram notification bot further enhances transparency by sending immediate alerts to students and employees when their attendance is successfully recorded. 
The system supports multiple user roles, including Admin, Student, Teacher, and Employee, each provided with dedicated dashboards for seamless interaction. Administrators can manage users, generate QR codes, monitor analytics, and view attendance in real time. Overall, the Smart Attendance System creates a secure, efficient, and user-friendly attendance workflow that reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, eliminates proxy attendance, and supports scalable deployment across institutions and organizations
